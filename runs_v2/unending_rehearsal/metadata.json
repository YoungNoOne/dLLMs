The atmosphere is intense, and the actors are focused on their lines.\n\nAs the scene progresses, one of the actors, John, starts to feel uneasy. He notices that the stage is empty, and the audience is absent. He begins to wonder if he is really in the play or if he is just a character in the script.\n\nSuddenly, John hears a faint whisper in the back of the room. He turns around, but no one is there. He starts to question if he is really in the play or if he is just a character in the script.\n\nAs the scene continues, John starts to feel a sense of unease. He begins to wonder if he is really in the play or if he is just a character in the script.
