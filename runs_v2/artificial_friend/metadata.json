  "decoded": "Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily who lived in a small town with her family. One day, her parents gifted her a household robot named Max. Max was a sleek, silver robot with a friendly face and a soothing voice.\n\nAt first, Lily was a little wary of Max, but as she got to know him better, she realized that he was a kind and loyal companion. Max was designed to help Lily with household chores, but he also had a sense of humor and a love for adventure.\n\nAs the years went by, Lily and Max grew closer. They went on trips together, explored new places, and even started a small business. Max helped Lily with her work, and in return, Lily provided Max with love and care.\n\nDespite being a robot, Max had a heart of gold and a deep understanding of human emotions. He listened to Lily's problems and offered her words of encouragement. Lily, in turn, provided Max with support and companionship.\n\nTheir friendship was a testament to the power of love and companionship. Lily and Max proved that even the most unlikely of friends can form a lifelong bond. And so, they lived happily ever after, side by side, as human and robot.",
