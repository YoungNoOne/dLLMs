  "decoded": "Ladies and gentlemen,\n\nToday, we gather to celebrate the life of a man who was not just a person, but a force of nature. His name is John Doe, and he is not just a man, but a version of himself.\n\nJohn Doe was a man who lived a life of love and compassion. He was a father, a husband, and a friend. He was a man who believed in the power of love and the importance of family. He was a man who was not afraid to speak his mind and to stand up for what he believed in.\n\nBut what makes John Doe truly special is that he is not just a version of himself. He is a version of himself who has been touched by the power of the universe. He is a version of himself who has been guided by the wisdom of the ages. He is a version of himself who has been blessed by the love of others.\n\nToday, we celebrate the life of a man who was not just a person, but a version of himself. We celebrate the life of a man who was not just a man, but a force of nature. We celebrate the life of a man who was not just a man, but a legend.\n\nThank you.",
