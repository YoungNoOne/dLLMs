  "decoded": "Dear [Recipient's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally express my decision regarding the registration of our friendship under the new legal protocols for interpersonal relationships.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I have decided to decline the registration of our friendship. While I appreciate the effort and consideration you have shown in this matter, I have determined that our relationship does not meet the criteria for registration.\n\nPlease understand that this decision is not a reflection of the quality of our friendship, but rather a result of the legal requirements that must be met. I hope that this rejection does not harm our relationship, and I am committed to maintaining a positive and respectful relationship with you.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about the registration process, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am more than happy to provide you with more information and guidance.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation. I look forward to continuing our friendship in other ways.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n\n[Your Position]\n\n[Your Contact Information]\n\n[Your Company/Organization]\n\n[Date]\n\nNote: This letter is a template and should be customized according to the specific situation and context.",
