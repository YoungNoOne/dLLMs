  "decoded": "Journalist: So, you're saying that a child born with AI-enhanced cognition began teaching philosophy at age five? That's quite a claim. Can you explain how this works?\n\nResearcher: Well, the child was born with a neural architecture that allows them to process information at a much faster rate than a typical child. This enables them to grasp complex concepts at a much younger age.\n\nJournalist: But doesn't this raise questions about the ethics of using AI to enhance cognition?\n\nResearcher: That's a valid concern. However, we believe that this is a natural extension of human intelligence and should not be viewed as a form of genetic modification.\n\nJournalist: And what about the potential for misuse? Could this child's abilities be exploited for nefarious purposes?\n\nResearcher: We take that very seriously. We have strict safeguards in place to ensure that the child's abilities are only used for positive purposes.\n\nJournalist: So, what does this mean for this child's future? Will they be the next Albert Einstein?\n\nResearcher: It's too early to say. However, we believe that this child has the potential to make significant contributions to the fields of philosophy and artificial intelligence.",
