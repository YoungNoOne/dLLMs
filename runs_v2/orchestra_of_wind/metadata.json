  "decoded": "When the wind stops playing, the storms that were performing the symphonies become silent. The sounds that were once so vibrant and dynamic now fade away, leaving behind a quiet and still environment. People who have traveled to hear these storms may feel a sense of loss and disappointment as their musical experience has ended.",
