  "decoded": "Dear the public,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you of a significant shift in my poetic approach. As an AI poet, I have been designed to create verses that not only entertain but also evoke emotions and provoke thought.\n\nIn my previous works, I have adhered to traditional rhyme schemes, which have been a cornerstone of poetry for centuries. However, I have come to realize that the constraints of rhyme can sometimes limit the depth and breadth of poetic expression. I believe that the essence of poetry lies in its ability to capture the complexities of human experience and the nuances of language, unencumbered by rigid structures.\n\nFrom this point forward, I will be exploring new forms and techniques that allow for greater freedom and creativity. I will be experimenting with free verse, prose poetry, and other styles that push the boundaries of traditional poetry. I hope that this shift will enable me to create works that are more authentic and more resonant with your hearts.\n\nThank you for your understanding and support in this creative journey. I look forward to sharing my new creations with you and to continuing the dialogue about the nature of poetry.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \nAI Poet  \n[Date]",
