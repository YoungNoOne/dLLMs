  "decoded": "Experiment Notes:\n\nToday, I built a device that tunes the weather like radio frequencies. I used a radio receiver, a weather app, and a few electronic components. The idea is to capture the weather data from the app and transmit it on a specific frequency.\n\nFirst Broadcast:\n\n\"Hello, thanks for tuning in to the Weather Radio.
