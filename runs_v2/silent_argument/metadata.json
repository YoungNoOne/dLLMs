  "prompt": "Two friends argue without saying a word. Describe what happens.",
  "decoded": "When two friends argue without saying a word, it often means that they are expressing their disagreement through non-verbal cues. This can include:\n\n1. **Body Language**: They might stand away from each other, cross their arms, or shift their weight, indicating discomfort or tension.\n\n2. **Facial Expressions**: They might fur their brows, purse their lips, or narrow their eyes, showing frustration or annoyance.\n\n3. **Gestures**: They might use hand gestures, such as waving their arms or tapping their fingers, to emphasize their point.\n\n4. **Eye Contact**: They might avoid eye contact, which can be a sign of discomfort or disagreement.\n\n5. **Posture**: They might slouch or lean back, indicating discomfort or disagreement.\n\n6. **Foot Movement**: They might shift their feet, which can be a sign of discomfort or disagreement.\n\n7. **Breathing**: They might breathe quickly or deeply, indicating stress or tension.\n\nThese non-verbal cues can create a sense of tension and discomfort between the two friends, even if they don't say a word. It's a subtle way for them to express their disagreement without having to resort to verbal arguments.",
