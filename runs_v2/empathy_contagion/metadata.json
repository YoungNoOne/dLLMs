  "decoded": "Dear Diary,\n\nToday, I was called to the hospital to treat a patient who was suffering from a severe headache. As soon as I entered the room, I felt a sharp pain in my head. I tried to ignore it, but it only got worse. I couldn't stop it, and I felt like I was going to collapse.\n\nI tried to lie down, but it didn't help. I couldn't stop the pain, and I felt like I was going to pass out. I couldn't believe this was happening to me. I was supposed to be a doctor, and I was supposed to be able to help my patients.\n\nI tried to call for help, but I was too weak to speak. I couldn't believe this was happening to me. I was supposed to be a doctor, and I was supposed to be able to help my patients.\n\nI couldn't believe this was happening to me. I was supposed to be a doctor, and I was supposed to be able to help my patients.\n\nI couldn't believe this was happening to me. I was supposed to be a doctor, and I was supposed to be able to help my patients.\n\nDear Diary,\n\n[Your Name]",
