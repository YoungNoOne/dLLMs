My reflection is not just a copy of me; it's a new, independent entity.\n\nI try to greet my reflection, but it doesn't respond. It's as if it's not even there. I try to talk to it, but it doesn't respond. It's as if it's not even me.\n\nI start to feel a sense of unease. This is not a normal reflection. This is a new, independent being that refuses to mimic me. I wonder what's going on. Is this a glitch in the system, or is it something more?\n\nAs I try to make sense of it, I start to notice strange things. My reflection is not just a copy of me; it's a new, independent entity with its own thoughts and emotions. It's as if it's a separate being, separate from my own.\n\nI don't know what to do. This is not a normal reflection. This is a new, independent being that refuses to mimic me. I wonder what's going on. Is this a glitch, or is it something more?",
