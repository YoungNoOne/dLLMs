  "prompt": "Describe a garden where plants are mechanical but emotions are organic. How do visitors interact with it?",
  "decoded": "In this unique garden, visitors can interact with the mechanical plants by placing their hands on them, which triggers a gentle breeze that rustles the leaves. Additionally, visitors can express their emotions by speaking into a nearby device, which causes the plants to respond by swaying or bending in harmony with the emotions expressed.",
