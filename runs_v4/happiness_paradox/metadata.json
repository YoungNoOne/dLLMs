Obsession with happiness can lead to emptiness, anxiety, and alienation from genuine meaning.\n\nWhen we focus solely on happiness, we may neglect other important aspects of life, such as relationships, community, and personal growth. We may become overly concerned with our own needs and desires, rather than considering the needs and desires of others. This can lead to a sense of emptiness and anxiety, as we may feel disconnected from the world around us.\n\nFurthermore, obsession with happiness can lead to alienation from genuine meaning.
